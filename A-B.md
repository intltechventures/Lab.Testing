  + Definition:
    * "A/B testing is a process where some of the audience receives one version of the product (usually unchanged) and others get an alternative version (i.e. with a different feature or look). The audience's reactions to different alternatives will determine which version is more beneficial to the Product goals."

  + 8 principles of a successful A/B test:

    1. "Expect the unexpected - While you aim to change specific metrics, monitor a wide spectrum of KPIs. You never know what were the unexpected consequences!"

    2. "Make the exclusive - Don't run multiple A/B tests at once unless you can ensure with 100% certainty that they won't influence one another. This is achieved either by audience segmentation or by having tests being far away from each other in the product."

    3. "Choose the right size of the audience - While usually you want to run a 50/50 experiment, you may choose to test on a smaller group if you are afraid your test might also have negative consequences."

    4. "Make it technically stellar - Tracking has to work perfectly from the get-go and you need to be able to configure, launch, and complete the experiment at a whim!"

    5. "Ensure statistical significance - For smaller audience products you may need to run the experiment longer to make sure the results are meaningful. There are special calculators for that on the web!"

    6. "Don't market the experiments - Users can either dislike being experimented on or hate to be missing out on a brand-new feature. Best to keep it private until the results come in and you can"

    7. "Document the results well - It will help you gloat with success later or prevent others in the company from wasting time on similar initiatives. Failing is OK, repeating the mistake is the true disaster."

    8. "Keep common sense when choosing whether to A/B test or not - A/B testing bugs and some smaller features will give you no benefit and will add technical complexity."
